## 🌍 Problem Statement

Energy waste in office buildings is one of the most overlooked contributors 
to CO₂ emissions. Most buildings have no intelligent system to forecast 
consumption, detect waste outside office hours, or estimate savings from 
efficiency improvements.

This dashboard solves that — instantly.

---

## 🎯 What This App Does

Input current building and weather conditions → get:
- ⚡ Predicted energy consumption (Wh)
- 🌿 CO₂ emitted (kg)
- 💡 Monthly CO₂ savings if consumption is reduced by X%
- ⚠️ Alerts for energy waste outside office hours

## 📸 Results

### 📊 Model Performance
![Model Metrics](screenshots/model_metrics.png)

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| **MAE** | 22.98 Wh |
| **RMSE** | 50.96 Wh |
| **MAPE** | 22.28% |

### 📈 Actual vs Predicted Energy Consumption
![Actual vs Predicted](screenshots/actual_vs_predicted.png)

The model closely tracks real consumption patterns including peak 
usage spikes and overnight low-consumption periods.

### 🧠 SHAP Feature Importance
![SHAP Feature Importance](screenshots/shap_feature_importance.png)

**Key insight:** Recent consumption (`lag_1`, `rolling_mean_6`) 
dominates predictions — confirming that energy usage follows strong 
short-term momentum patterns. External weather (`T_out`, `RH_out`) 
and time-of-day (`hour`) are secondary but meaningful signals.

## ⚙️ Feature Engineering

| Feature | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `lag_1` | Lag | Consumption 10 minutes ago |
| `lag_6` | Lag | Consumption 1 hour ago |
| `lag_144` | Lag | Consumption 24 hours ago |
| `rolling_mean_6` | Rolling | Average consumption last hour |
| `rolling_std_6` | Rolling | Volatility of last hour |
| `hour` | Time | Hour of day (0–23) |
| `is_office_hours` | Time | 1 if between 8am–6pm |
| `is_weekend` | Time | 1 if Saturday or Sunday |
| `T_out` | Weather | Outside temperature (°C) |
| `RH_out` | Weather | Outside humidity (%) |
| `Windspeed` | Weather | Wind speed (m/s) |

## 🤖 Model Pipeline

### Hyperparameters Tuned via Optuna

| Parameter | Search Range |
|---|---|
| `n_estimators` | 100 – 400 |
| `max_depth` | 3 – 10 |
| `learning_rate` | 0.01 – 0.3 |
| `subsample` | 0.6 – 1.0 |
| `colsample_bytree` | 0.6 – 1.0 |

> ⚠️ Note: Time-series data requires a **sequential train/test split**  
> (no shuffling) to prevent data leakage.

## 💡 Key Insights

- **Short-term memory dominates** — the last 10 minutes of consumption 
  (`lag_1`) is by far the strongest predictor
- **Time of day matters** — `hour` is the 5th most important feature, 
  confirming office usage patterns are highly time-dependent
- **Weather has moderate impact** — `T_out` and `RH_out` influence 
  consumption but are secondary to recent usage history
- **Weekends show significantly lower** consumption — `is_weekend` 
  captures this behavioural pattern

## 🌱 Why I Built This

Energy waste in offices is largely invisible — no alerts, no forecasts, 
no actionable insights. This project shows how ML can make that waste 
visible, quantifiable, and actionable.

As someone transitioning from civil engineering into data science, 
I built this to contribute to the energy transition using skills 
that bridge both worlds.
